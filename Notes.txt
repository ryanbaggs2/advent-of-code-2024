Day 1:

Distance between Location IDs.

Building the arrays O(logn):
read the text file into a buffer
read line
parse line into left and right array

Calculate distance O(n):
sort array
distance between smallest for both, then second smallest for both, and so on (absolute value)
get the total distance between the two lists
print the answer
